    question: 'how do you decorate your home with the symbols of Kwanzaa?',
    answer: `- Kinara or candle holder
- 7 candles, 3 red, 3 green, and 1 black (for each day of kwanzaa)
- cloth or mat to set kinara on
- ear of corn for each child in the household
- unity cup: mkeka
- put aafrican food and crops, yams, peanut and other food that symbolized african heritage

These are the recommended items needed. IF you do not have the specific item, alternatives can be used.
i.e., if no kinara, use candle holders; if you are unable to obtain the specific colors for each candle, use any candle as long you have 7 total candles to represent each day
